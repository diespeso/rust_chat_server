# rust_chat_server
A very small, very dumb and very bad chat server to send messages in a common place for every participant.

This is the first version 0.1.0, no password authentication, no storage of messages, only a platform to send messages to anyone in my local network.

works fine on android: Opera, the websockets wont work in chrome or samsungs internet browswer.

works fine on pc: chrome and edge.

I used actix for this.

The code might be a nightmare, not a good coder :(
